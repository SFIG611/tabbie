great for these types of students,"education majors, science majors, health care related majors"
tips for prospective students,"your school work should be your main priority. it is a big transition from high school to college, and you want to academically perform your best."
bang for the buck,"there are certain things that can be pricey, but it can be very beneficial. illinois state offers unlimited food plans, and a good membership at their fitness facility. there are also many inexpensive activities offered at the campus, like double feature fridays (two movies, not yet released on dvd, for the cost of a dollar.)"
am enjoying being here,illinois state is a comfortable school. it is like a home away from home.
am learning a lot,"it is a great school, with incredible professors. they teach you a lot of new, exciting information that can be taken with you in the future."
