campus safety,the campus safety is awesome. police patrol the grounds and parking lot.
clubs and activities,i did not join any but heard good things about this.
great for these types of students,"this school is great for everyone especially people who just graduated high school, people who aren't sure what they want to do, or people who have been out of school for a long time and want to get in the rhythm of being in college"
share any unusual traditions or locations on campus,i enjoy the humanities and language art and activities in the building. it is neat to see peoples art and to learn about different classes
bang for the buck,they are building another building for a library which will be much bigger and offer more study rooms and computer areas.
what to do for fun,"they have a open gym for basketball and tennis courts. they offer many free activities for students like aerobics, pilates, open swim and more."
food and dining,they offer many different types of foods and have a large cafeteria so students can sit and enjoy their meal. the food is affordable and edible:)
dorm life,i am off campus
academic rigor,the teachers all expect you to be there and do your work. if you don't show up its your loss and you miss lecture and notes. the work is challenging yet not difficult if you study and show up for class
tips for prospective students,"this is a great school for people who just graduated high school or for those who want to go to school yet are intimidated by large schools. this is a big school with lots of students and teachers but it is without the rush of larger schools. there are many places to hang out, meet friends or study. the teachers are professional, friendly and real. most of them enjoy their work, the students and are willing to go above and beyond to help their students reach their potential. its a great school and offers tours."
in three sentences,the atmosphere is wonderful. the students and teachers are helpful and nice. my teachers have all been amazing and have helped me so much.
