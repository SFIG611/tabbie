mem,"these numbers monitor the memory statistics of data server. the first number is the amount of memory used. the second number is the total memory available. the colored bar represents the percentage of memory used. a blue bar is used for values up to 60%, yellow up to 80%, and red up to 100%."
pflts,"these numbers are the number of data analyzers connected to the data server, and measure the delay from when a packet is queued from the data server lan connection to when it is sent to the data analyzer. the delay is measured in milliseconds. the data is in the form c - x/a/n where c - connection count x - maximum delay a - average delay n - minimum delay the colored bar represents the average delay, with the maximum set at 500ms. a blue bar is used for values up to 250ms, yellow up to 400ms, and red for 400ms."
pfw/com,"these numbers measure the delay from when a packet is queued in the data analyzer to when it is written to the data server. the delay is measured in milliseconds. the data is in the form x/a/n where x - maximum delay a - average delay n - minimum delay the colored bar represents the average delay, with the maximum set at 500ms. a blue bar is used for values up to 250ms, yellow up to 400ms, and red for 400ms."
bio,"these numbers monitor the packets that have been read using this connection, including multicast ""hello"" messages for nodes that are not being monitored. the first number is the number of packets per second. the second number is the number of bytes per second. note that for wide area network connection, this does not include any overhead that tcp/ip introduces when transmitting the data. the blue bar represents the number of packets read in the last monitoring interval. a full bar represents 50 or more packets per second."
dio,the first (or only) number is the number of packets currently waiting on the server to be read on this connection. a number consistently greater than 0 indicates congestion or a failing connection. the yellow bar also reflects this number. a full bar represents 50 or more packets in the queue. the second number (when shown) is a count of the number of packets that have been discarded because the write queue on the server grew too large. a red bar indicates the number of packets that were discarded in the last monitoring interval. a full bar represents 50 or more packets discarded.
cpuqs,"these numbers monitor the packets that have been written using this connection. the first number is the number of packets per second. the second number is the number of bytes per second. note that for wide area network connections, this does not include any overhead that tcp/ip introduces when transmitting the data. the blue bar represents the number of packets written in the last monitoring interval. a full bar represents 50 or more packets per second."
events,"the first (or only) number is the number of packets currently waiting to be written to the server on this connection. a number consistently greater than 0 indicates congestion. for a wan connection, this might indicate a slow or failing connection. the yellow bar reflects this number. a full bar represents 50 or more packets in the queue. the second number (when shown) is a count of the number of packets that have been discarded because the write queue grew too large. the red bar indicates the number of packets that were discarded in the last monitoring interval. a full bar represents 50 or more packets discarded."
proc ct,"the status shows the state of the server connection. if the status is error or failed, the error text is in the hw model field."
os version,the version and build number show what version of the availability manager that the data server is running.
