tips for prospective students,"i would recommend any students coming to penn state to get involved. it is really easy to start getting involved at penn state. once youâre involved you will make many new friends and connections that you wouldn't be able to make anywhere else. also you should take the time to get together all of the available tutoring places on campus for each of your classes. knowing when tutoring is offered will really help you manage you time. lastly, get football tickets. perhaps one of the most exciting times at penn state is at its football games. at these games students become unified unlike any other school."
bang for the buck,"i am an out-of-state student, which means that my tuition is exceedingly higher. even though my tuition is much higher than in-state students, penn state is still a great school for its cost. for one price penn state provides a university with tradition, high standards of education, research opportunities, and school unity that are hard to find anywhere else."
am enjoying being here,"outside of an amazing education penn state has offered ways for me to meet new people like myself and get involved in the community. one way i was able to meet new people was to live in a slo (special living option) called the heal house. heal stands for healthy education and living. this living option has a lot of people who enjoy living a healthy lifestyle, which is eating healthy and exercising regularly. we have grown into a family and it makes it incredibly easier to live a healthy lifestyle when all of your friends are doing the same thing you are. penn state is also active in thon. thon is an organization which raises money for pediatric cancer. i am part of the heal house thon committee which raises money for thon. it is really enjoyable to participate in this organization. one of the great things we do go on canning trips. these trips have us travel to different states trying to raise money for pediatric cancer. we bond and have a great time together. we often find days to just go sightseeing. at our last canning trip we raised almost $3000. this has been an excellent start to my college career at penn state."
am learning a lot,"pennsylvania state university is a fantastic and top-notch university. i have been here for one semester so far and i am confident that choosing penn state was the best decision i have made thus far. penn state provides an outstanding education. the professors really go out of their way in order to provide help. they all provide office hours other than the times that they have listed. if you need help all you must do is simply email that teacher and request that you meet with them for extra help. all of my professors that i asked were more than happy to oblige. each and every professor is an expert in their subject and it shows in the lecture when they do not have to worry about how to teach the subject, but instead how to make it fun and appealing for its students. one example is in my chem 110 class. in this class my professor understood that this subject was not always the most appealing. so he would give live demonstration of what chemistry can do. one demonstration he gave was the explosion of hydrogen gas by filling a balloon with gas and the igniting it. it definitely woke me up from my nap and kept me engaged in the class. in addition to professors there are teaching assistants and the penn state learning center. these two sources provide excellent opportunities to get free tutoring and extra help studying. this saved me the week of finals. outside of this education i have already been able to begin research for my major of electrical engineering. i was able to get a head start compared to other students at different school because freshman usually don't start research their first semester, let alone their first semester."
