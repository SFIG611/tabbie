answer choice,what i write,what iâm thinking
(a) the first is a generalization that the consumer advocate accepts as true; the second is presented as a consequence that follows from the truth of that generalization.â?,"r a b c d e ca: l ads charge < < restrict ã¢â â > ads, ã¢â â costs but if no req on fees, costs prob go up b/c no incent to give good price","the first boldface does go against what the ca believes. the second boldface is that positionâ?â?what position? the caâs main positionâ? is the conclusion. the second boldface is not the caâs conclusion, though; rather it is support for the caâs conclusion. eliminate (e)."
(b) the first is a pattern of cause and effect that the consumer advocate argues will be repeated in the case at issue; the second acknowledges a circumstance in which that pattern would not hold.,"r a b c d e ca: l ads charge < < restrict ã¢â â > ads, ã¢â â costs but if no req on fees, costs prob go up b/c no incent to give good price","hmm. the first one is a pattern, but the ca thinks that it will not be repeated in the special case described. this answer is not correct."
(c) the first is a pattern of cause and effect that the consumer advocate predicts will not hold in the case at issue; the second offers a consideration in support of that prediction.â?,"r a b c d e ca: l ads charge < < restrict ã¢â â > ads, ã¢â â costs but if no req on fees, costs prob go up b/c no incent to give good price","read carefully! the opening part of the answer looks the same as (b), but thereâs a crucial difference: yes, the ca does believe that the pattern will not hold in the special case described. what about the second piece? the language gets confusing: in support of what prediction? the word prediction is used in the first half to describe the ca. the ca predicts something. the second boldface is used to support the caâs prediction, so this choice looks good. check the others."
(d) the first is evidence that the consumer advocate offers in support of a certain prediction; the second is that prediction.â?,"r a b c d e ca: l ads charge < < restrict ã¢â â > ads, ã¢â â costs but if no req on fees, costs prob go up b/c no incent to give good price","the ca does predict something but does not use the first boldface to support that prediction. rather, the first boldface contradicts the caâs prediction. eliminate (d)."
(e) the first acknowledges a consideration that weighs against the main position that the consumer advocate defends; the second is that position.,"r a b c d e ca: l ads charge < < restrict ã¢â â > ads, ã¢â â costs but if no req on fees, costs prob go up b/c no incent to give good price",the description of the first boldface is accurate; the ca does accept that it is true. the second does not go along with the first though. the two are on opposite sides of the fence. eliminate (a).
