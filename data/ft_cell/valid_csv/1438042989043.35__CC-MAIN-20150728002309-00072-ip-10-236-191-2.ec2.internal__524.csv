1,alabama,7-0 (4-0),1,"why are they the number one team in the land? well, i got 52 reasons for you. that is -- the number of points scored in their game against arkansas... none of them by the razorbacks offense. yep, 52-0 was the final. miss the big 10 a little, beilema? if youâre an alabama fan, you should be smiling. lsu fell for the 2nd time this season, all but guaranteeing the tide a spot in the sec title game... with their potential opponent being missouri. one other bright spot, the top ranked tide take on tennessee this weekend.",1,1
2,oregon,7-0 (4-0),2,3,2,"it was an interesting night down at autzen stadium. mariota turned the football over for the first time this season, the ducks were in pink helmets, connor halliday set an fbs record with 89 pass attempts, nick allioti called out mike leach... but the end result was the same, oregon rolling to a 62-38 win. the cougars always find a way to hang with the ducks, and saturday was no different. but don't let the final score fool you -- wsu scored two touchdowns against oregon's scout team in the final few minutes. we've finally reached the meat and potatoes of oregon's schedule; they'll get ranked teams in each of their next two games -- vs. ucla on saturday, and at stanford on november 7th. if the ducks make it through these next two games, go ahead and punch their ticket to pasadena."
3,florida state,6-0 (4-0),4,2,3,"well hello there, florida state. the seminoles have been flying under the radar for most of the season, not to mention the shadow acc front runner clemson was casting over them. you can officially kiss that shadow goodbye -- behind impressive freshman jameis winston, the noles' absolutely rolled in death valley, 51-14. the game was never close; the seminoles jumped out to a 17-0 lead and never looked back. not only did this win put florida state atop the acc standings, but also made them a clear cut title contender (still needing a loss from oregon or alabama). fsu still has miami (fl) and florida on the schedule -- but the question always surrounds their program -- can they avoid ""clemsoning?"""
4,ohio state,7-0 (3-0),5,4,4,"another week, and another unimpressive win over a below average team for the buckeyes. ohio state had to sweat it out saturday, before edging out iowa 34-24 at the horseshoe. stop me if you've heard this before -- ohio state's schedule only gets easier from here on out. the five opponents standing in the way of a perfect season in columbus? penn state, purdue, illinois, indiana and michigan. good luck."
5,miami (fl),6-0 (2-0),9,7,7,"talk about a turn of events -- miami was a few minutes away from an embarrassing loss on the road to north carolina on thursday. now, they find themselves in the top 5. that's what happens in a week when the 3rd, 6th, 7th, 8th, 10th and 11th ranked teams all lose. the hurricanes avoided disaster, and now sit clearly atop the acc coastal standings. two hurdles remain for the ""u"" -- at florida state on november 2nd, and the following week at home against virginia tech."
13,6-0 (3-0),baylor,6,8,6,"another beneficiary from ""upset saturday"" was baylor -- the bears cruised through iowa state 71-7, and now, believe it or not -- are right smack dab in the middle of the national title conversation. the offense leads the nation in almost every category, but the rough part of the schedule still remains for the bears. only one of their final six games are a gimmie (this week against kansas) but after that it's all uphill -- vs oklahoma, vs texas tech, at oklahoma state, at tcu and versus texas."
7,missouri,7-0 (3-0),14,5,5,"the missouri tigers have risen to the top 10 quicker and in a more impressive fashion than any other team i've ever seen. two weeks ago, they were unranked. now? how's 7th? missouri found a way to knock off florida without starting quarterback james franklin -- and now shockingly have a two-game lead in the sec east. only two manageable hurdles remain on their schedule, vs south carolina (this weekend) and vs texas a&m the final game of the regular season. can they continue to shock the world?"
8,clemson,6-1 (4-1),9,9,3,"whoa. i can officially say i didn't see this one coming. clemson had two close contests against north carolina state and boston college -- but the strength from their win over georgia kept me a believer. that was until saturday night. florida state went into death valley unfazed, jumping out to a 17-0 lead and never looking back on their way to a 51-14 romping. what's next for clemson? well, the first thing is to regroup. but luckily for them the schedule is easy -- only one ranked team (south carolina) remains on the slate. unfortunately, they'll need two acc losses (or, a ""clemsoning"") out of florida state if they even want a chance at the acc title game."
9,stanford,8,12,6,6-1 (4-1),"things can change quickly in a week -- and stanford is a prime example of that. the cardinal go from a devastating loss on the road to utah, to knocking off a top-10 team in ucla and being right back in the mix. their season will still come down to one game, like we all thought before the season started, versus the 2nd ranked oregon ducks on november, 9th. but they'll have to get through a pesky beaver team in corvallis, to make the next one live up to the hype."
10,lsu,6-2 (3-2),6,13,13,"arguably the biggest loser saturday, other than clemson, was lsu. not only because of the heart-breaking fashion they lost at ole miss (27-24 on a last second field goal) -- but more-so because they now don't control their own destiny. saturday was the second sec loss of the season for the tigers, and now even a win over #1 alabama in two weeks will still leave them on the outside looking in at the sec title game. lsu gets furman (who?) this weekend, before that showdown with alabama."
11,texas tech,7-0 (4-0),15,10,"the hottest coaching name in the country remains kliff kingsbury, after another win (33-27 at west virginia) on saturday, the red raiders have improved to 7-0 on the season. however, much like their undefeated big 12 compadre, baylor, the meat of the schedule remains for texas tech. starting this week at oklahoma -- the final five games are a gauntlet (oklahoma state, kansas state, baylor & texas).",10
12,oklahoma st.,5-1 (2-1),17,19,19,"the cowboys find themselves ranked back in the top-15, but simply because of attrition. oklahoma state only managed a 24-10 over tcu at home, but because of a number of upsets -- rose five spots in the poll. that makes three unimpressive weeks for mike gundy's group; a loss to west virginia, followed by close wins over kansas state and tcu. my guess is they'll fall before it's all said and done -- texas tech, baylor and oklahoma all remain on the schedule."
13,oklahoma,6-1 (3-1),19,15,17,"it was shaky early -- but oklahoma did what they were supposed to do against kansas, eventually pulling away with a 34-19 win. it was a nice bounce back week, after being embarrassed by long-time rival texas, but questions still surrounds this team. it's hard to get a read on the big 12 -- are (undefeated) texas tech and baylor for real? or is oklahoma still the team to beat, despite their lopsided loss to texas?"
14,ucla,12,7,12,5-1 (2-1),"talk about laying an egg in the biggest game of the season thus far -- both ucla and heisman hopeful brett hundley looked loss in a 24-10 loss at stanford on saturday. i'll admit, the outcome of this game shocked me. i expected ucla to take the next step as a program, notch a marquee win over a top-15 team on the road and plant their flag as the pac-12's second best team... but that didn't happen. the play-calling was terrible, the execution was terrible -- but more importantly, brett hundley was terrible. once believed to be the best qb in the conference; hundley completed 24 passes for only 192 yards (4.9 yards per completion) and threw two picks. things only get tougher for the bruins -- who have to travel to eugene to take on the 2nd ranked ducks this weekend."
15,texas a&m,5-2 (2-2),11,16,14,"if you had a chance to watch the texas a&m vs aubrun game, you now know what a funeral of 90,000+ people would sound like. johnny manziel went down in the 4th quarter (before returning) and you could hear a fly fart in college station. that injury proved to be the key -- the aggies had to kick a field goal, then went three and out -- while manziel was on the sidelines. that allowed ample time for auburn to turn a 10-point deficit into a 4 point lead, and that was all she wrote. this loss not only knocks a&m out of the national title race -- it could also end manziel's heisman hopes. it will take huge efforts the last two weeks of the season (at lsu and missouri) not to mention wins, if he wants to become only the 2nd two-time winner in heisman history."
6-1 (3-1),auburn,16,na,11,11,"might seem weird to see auburn ranked behind a&m, a team they beat on the road this weekend, but a&m is undoubtedly the better team. without an injury to manziel in the 4th quarter (see above) aurburn falls short. i will say this -- helluva job by auburn to turn this thing around from the dumpster fire it was a year ago (take notes, usc). but let's not forget this team lost by two touchdowns earlier this year to lsu, and only has one quality win to their name thus far. the scary thing is -- they won't be tested over the next three weeks -- starting with florida atlantic (i hate you, sec) this weekend."
"tennessee was bound to notch an upset at some point this season -- and south carolina provided that opportunity. after falling just short against georgia, tennessee wasn't about to let this one slip away. as for south carolina, it's just another year for steve spurrior. loads of talent, all the potential in the world, and multiple losses. will this team ever get over the hump, and make a bcs game? the gamecocks find themselves two games behind missouri in the sec east -- but they can cut that lead in half, when they travel to columbia to take on missouri this week.",south carolina,5-2 (3-2),20,21,10,17
18,25,5-1 (2-0),18,24,nebraska,"the cornhuskers had the week off, staying put at #18 in the dirty poll. nebraska has minnesota on the road this weekend -- while michigan and michigan state still loom on the schedule if the huskers want to make it back to the big 10 title game."
19,louisville,6-1 (2-1),18,20,8,"finally. finally the fraud that was louisville got exposed. a 38-35 loss, at home, against central florida officially ended their non-existent national title hopes. oh, and teddy bridgewater can kiss his heisman hopes goodbye. other than that, things are looking up! mainly, because louisville doesn't play anyone the rest of the season."
20,michigan,6-1 (2-1),20,22,24,"howâs a 63-47 win versus indiana for excitement? michigan bounced back from an overtime heartbreaking loss against penn state, but the gauntlet of the schedule remains. after a week off, the wolverines have a marquee test against michigan state (1st in the leaders division) in east lansing."
21,fresno state,6-0 (3-0),21,17,15,"the bulldogs continued their run at a potential bcs game -- with a 38-17 win versus unlv. can't tell you much about fresno state, other than the fact they're 6-0 and the clear cut front runner in the mountain west conference."
22,21,7-0 (3-0),n. illinois,17,15,"from one potential bcs buster to another -- northern illinois improved to 7-0 on the season with a 38-17 win over central michigan. congrats to jordan lynch, who set an ncaa record for rushing yards in a single game."
23,oregon state,6-1 (4-0),23,25,na,"the beavers continued their torrid winning streak, this time over cal 49-17 down in berkley. that makes six consecutive wins now for the beavers, who sit a 6-1 following their disastrous opening weekend loss to eastern washington. but the question remains -- will the real beavers please stand up? we'll find out how ""good"" this team really is saturday night, when the 9th ranked stanford cardinal come up to corvallis. oh, and after that -- they face usc at home, arizona state on the road, washington in seattle, capped off by the ducks in eugene. good luck."
24,michigan st.,6-1 (3-0),24,na,na,"we often hear about how dominant sec defenses are, and listen to the arguments over who has the best defense in the country -- but one team is constantly left off the list, michigan state. the spartans can't score a point to save their lives, but damn is that defense good. a 14-0 win over purdue this weekend, pushed michigan state to 6-1 on the season, and firmly placed atop the leaders division in the big 10."
25,wisconsin,5-2 (3-1),25,na,22,"the badgers have bounced back nicely from back-to-back rough losses against arizona state and ohio state -- to win back-to-back games, this weekend over illinois 56-32 to salvage their season, and improve to 5-2."
